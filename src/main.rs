     * A server in tokio-proto is made up of three distinct parts:
     * A transport, which manages serialization of Rust request and response types to the underlying socket. In this guide, we will implement this using the Codec helper.
     * A protocol specification, which puts together a codec and some basic information about the protocol (is it multiplexed? streaming?).
     * A service, which says how to produce a response given a request. A service is basically an asynchronous function.
